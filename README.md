**Application Name: CAMP SEARCH**

**Summary**


CAMP Search is the first digital resource outdoor adventurers reach for to find a great campsite in the perfect location. 
CAMP Search will eventually be home to thousands of campsites across the United States with accompanying nightly rates, 
site details, amenities and more! Users will soon be able to review campsites, update information and add new sites.

CAMP Search will store all of the necessary information for a campsite in a one stop spot so campers can spend less time 
on their device and more time outdoors! Users can expect to find an accompanying website link to book a reservation, nightly 
fee and basic campsite information, such as site size, electrical/water/sewer hook-ups, fire pit, picnic tables and more.

This first deployment of CAMP Search includes a user login/logout feature, user reviews, top reviews and a database that 
holds all of the user and review information. More functionality is needed to bring CAMP Search fully operational - see 
the Future Work section below for more on this.

The target user population of CAMP Search are people that enjoy spending 
time in the outdoors and pitch a tent or tow a camper as a place to rest during their adventure. Often times, especially for those 
that tow a camper, people have specific needs, like having electric hook-ups, in mind when searching for a campsite. Finding 
the campsite that best fits your needs can be a daunting task due to the sheer number of campsite possibilities, be it at a state park, 
on federal land, a private RV park or a great place off the beaten path, also known as dry-docking.

The CAMP Search web application is built using a MEN (MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js) stack. The application is mostly built using 
Javascript. Handlebars.js is used for the views. Bootstrap is used extensively throughout the views for design. CAMP Search was deployed using Heroku.
c tables and more.


**Motivation**

For the design of the CAMP Search website I tried to stay simple, minimalist and understated - which is along the lines of how nature speaks to 
me. My goal was to create a clean and simple yet robustly informational website that was easy on the eyes. 

When first starting on the website I picked out a color scheme that focused on earthy rich tones and strayed away from bright colors.

The CAMP Search mountains/trees graphic in the CAMP Search logo was adopted from Pixabay, a website that hosts royalty-free stock photos and 
graphics for commercial and non-commercial use free of attribution. I used Adobe Illustrator to change the color of the logo and to add the 
CAMP Search text. All stock photos were downloaded from Pixabay.

I did not want the design of CAMP Search to get in the way of its core objective, that is to be a web application that allows camp-goers to 
quickly search for what they need and get back to spending more time outdoors or planning other more exciting aspects of their adventure - like a kayak trip!


**Future Work**

The ultimate objective of CAMP Search is for the application to be the first digital resource outdoor adventurers go to for when looking for a campsite. 
In order to achieve this goal, additional functionality must be added. 

CAMP Search needs to have a database of thousands of campsites across the United States with accompanying nightly rates, site details, amenities and much 
more. The user needs to have the ability to sort and filter campsites by the type of facility (i.e. state park, federal land, dry docking or private RV park), 
rating, amenities and geographic location.

A campsite search function is needed so that users can search for campsite locations by typing in the facility name or geographic location. Users should have 
the option to view their search results in a list format or on a map. The sort and filter function should be present to narrow down the results as desired.

Each campsite listing needs to have its own unique profile photo. As part of reviewing a campsite, users should be able to upload their own campsite photos.

CAMP Search relies on its dedicated users to submit new campsites that are not already in the database (like a newly found dry dock site) and suggest updates 
to current campsite information, like nightly rate and amenities. 

The homepage can showcase campsites based on a specific set of parameters, like highest rated, campsites with a view, near a beach, etc.

Partnering with a hiking trails or mountain bike trails web application is a natural progression for CAMP Search down the road.
