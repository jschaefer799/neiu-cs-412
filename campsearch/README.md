**Application Name: CAMP SEARCH**

**Project Topic/Objective**

CAMP SEARCH is the first digital resource outdoor adventurers reach for to find a great campsite in the perfect location.
CAMP SEARCH is home to thousands of campsites across the United States with accompanying nightly rates,
site details, amenities and more! Users can review campsites, update information and add new sites.

CAMP SEARCH stores all the necessary information for a campsite in a one stop spot so campers can spend less time on their
device and more time outdoors! Users can expect to find an accompanying website, nightly fee, basic campsite information, such
as site size, electrical/water/sewer hook-ups, fire pit, picnic tables and more.


**Motivation**

As an outdoor enthusiast, I know it can be exhausting to plan the perfect trip. Finding a place to call home
for the night (that isn't a hotel) is second only to choosing a destination - that's a big deal! 

There are a few web applications out there trying to make this a smoother process but by in large they are either too clunky,
difficult to navigate, buggy, out-dated or just don't quite get it right. 

This leaves the outdoor-goer to sift through multiple websites and maps in order to find that right campsite. CAMP SEARCH
is streamlining this process and creating a database of information that is user-friendly. Think kayak.com meets camping 
in a pop-up camper!

**Server-Side Components**

CAMP SEARCH is database driven. Users need to be able to access and input data to the database. The following are the main 
server-side components needed:

Users:
- Simple user sign up: Name, e-mail address, password
- User badges for top reviewers and top contributors

Campsites:

- GPS coordinates
- Picture(s)
- Name and/or number of site
- Name of park or RV park
- Public or private land
- Nightly fee 
- Type of campsite: tent, camper, RV size
- List of amenities: hook-ups, bathrooms, showers, etc.
- User reviews
- External website link for users to click on to make a reservation
